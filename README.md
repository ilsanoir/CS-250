Interpreting a user's needs and implementing in a program involves a conversion of ideas. Specifically, a user has a request of some sort that they would like in the software being developed and it is the job of the development team to take those ideas and translate them into code that reflects what the user requested. User stories help with this idea by providing a means of sorting and organizing a multitude of user requests. The organization that user stories provides can then help to streamline the subsequent development efforts on the software.
I would like to approach development with an "open to change" mentality. It is easy to be flustered by change in a project, but with the correct mindset, and realistic expectations, these changes can help most projects come to fruition in a better way than originally envisioned. I would like to work with user stories and develop incrementally, in sprints. These seem extremely convienient and highly condusive to working on software at a higher level.
Being a good team member in software development involves having your work done correctly, and at the promised time. It also includes being respectful to your fellow teammates, no matter their role, and offering assitance to anyone who might need it.
